<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<div class="second-container">
<p class="classparag"> Work Experience

I have worked in customer service and in healthcare for a number of years. I first started off as a Law graduate but I  wasn’t sure what path I wanted to take career wise. I have learnt a lot working with a charity in the arts to working in mental health. In the last year, I have actively decided to pursue a career in software development and actively sought a job working for a tech online healthcare company. My interest for software development grew as I was working alongside developers, giving them suggestions on how to improve their online platform as I was solving tech issues directly with customers.

I believe I have transferrable skills and I have a methodical approach when learning

<h2> Why Am I appplying for this Programme?</h2>
<div class="second-container">
<p class="classparag">My main motto in life is; it is better to have tried and failed, than to fail to try. I have also found that trying has given me the opportunities that I have sought. I initially found about this program through a friend.
  My main motto in life is; it is better to have tried and failed, than to fail to try. I initially found about  Founders and Coders through a friend as she knew I wanted a career change and my interest was in IT.

  My first introduction to software developing was tweaking the code to my myspace profile. Later on I helped design some promotional artwork for a friend’s blog. I taught myself how to use  Adobe Creative Suite, using Photoshop and Illustrator to make front end changes to the website and once again, I found myself editing code but on a Wordpress site. I was testing  out After Effects to work on a motion graphic project and yet  again, there were elements of coding included in the process. I have always been a creative and the more I pursue my creative interests, I see the demand to learn how to code. I now want to go down the more technical route (back-end) and focus more on coding. I also believe there is a lot of disparity in women and male representation in the field and I would like to bridge that gap.

  Founders and Coders particularly stood out to me because it works alongside Tech for Better to support non-profit and social impact start ups as I want to equally be in a position where I can share the knowledge I have learnt with others. My time during the short course introduced to some of the students Summer cohort students and potential students I will be working with if I were to continue with the course. The pair coding activities were extremely helpful in helping me fulfil my prerequisites. What I initially though was a difficult task, learning code, is now a challenge I enjoy.  </p>
