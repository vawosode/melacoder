<h2>A Very Philosophical Question; “Who Am I?”</h2>
<div class="second-container">
<p class="classparag">
  Ultimately I am a creative. I am either doodling on a sketch book or writing a script for a podcast. I have worn many hats from interning at a startup company, designing layouts for a magazine to drawing art work for a friend’s line of tote bags.  After graduating, I set up shop with a close friend and decided to start a blog; it was consisted of a reviews on film, theatre and literature and where to find the next flurry of afrocentric shows in London. This is when I first taught myself how to use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. We could not afford to pay for another graphic designer and I began to learn how to create promotional art work and tweak code on our website.

  I considered this a hobby and from time to time I would work with small local businesses and create a logo or design a poster. My nine to five jobs would either fall under administration, customer service or healthcare but recently I’ve decided to follow my passion and focus on forging a career in IT.

  On my day off, you can either find me, walking the length of a park, trying out a new recipe or force-reading a self help book, the latest one being; “Quiet: The Power of Introverts” by Susan Caine.

<h2> Why I Am Applying for this Programme? I Love Bootcamps!</h2>
<div class="second-container">
<p class="classparag">

  I was first introduced to Founders and Coders by a friend who I also consider a mentor. As aforementioned, I wanted to make a complete career change and learn how to code. My earliest memory of working with code was creating an interactive background on my myspace page.

  The need to learn how to code has always been on demand when I worked on projects such as the blog I partnered with for a friend or an attempt  at creating a motion graphic video on YouTube. These creative projects exposed me to the STEM industry. My interest has led me a few workshops, including the 4-week short course at Space4.  My time during the short course introduced me to some of the summer cohort students and potential students I will be working with in the future. The pair coding activities were extremely helpful in helping me fulfil my prerequisites.

  I have actively sought a career in the IT field and spent the last 6 months working at an online healthcare company. It exposed me more to the various employment opportunities in IT. This encouraged me to go down a more technical route and learn the back-end of design that goes into developing websites and apps.


  Founders and Coders particularly stood out to me because it works alongside Tech for Better to support non-profit and social impact start ups as I want to equally be in a position where I can share the knowledge I have learnt with others. I believe there is a lot of disparity in women and male representation in the STEM industry and I would like to bridge that gap.

  The winter cohort is full time study programme which I prefer as I work best in intensive work environments and this would be the perfect opportunity for me to practice my newly learnt skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

  I believe there is a lot of disparity in women and male representation in the STEM industry and I would like to bridge that gap.

  My time during the short course introduced me to some of the summer cohort students and potential students I will be working with if I were to continue with the course. The pair coding activities were extremely helpful in helping me fulfil my prerequisites.
