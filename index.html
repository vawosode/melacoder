<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<div class="second-container">
<p class="classparag"> I didn't just want to tweek code on wordpress, i wanted to be the designer behind the themes. I am follwing my dreams. I would hope to gain a basic software engineering knowledge, that would provide me an opportunity at pursing a career in software
  development. I would like to interact with other individuals in the same boat as me or who are even more advanced so we can sharpen our skills together. I would like to meet women who are already working in software engineering and find out what
  their route was in creating a career path in this line of work. I would like to find out what the culture in a typical IT environment is like and whether there are more initiatives for women to get into IT and develop their skills in this area.
  It would also be encouraging for Sky to expose students more to the practicality of the role and what other courses can be taken to develop my skills in software engineering.

<h2> Why am I appplying for this program?</h2>
<div class="second-container">
<p class="classparag">My main motto in life is; it is better to have tried and failed, than to fail to try. I have also found that trying has given me the opportunities that I have sought. I initially found about this program through a friend.

My first introduction to software developing was tweaking the code to my myspace profile. Over time my interest in software development peaked when I helped design some promotional artwork for a friend’s blog. I taught myself how to use  Adobe Creative Suite, using Photoshop and Illustrator to make front end changes to the website and once again, I found myself editing code but on a Wordpress site. I have always been a creative and the more I pursue my creative interests, I see the demand to learn how to code. I now want to go down the more technical route (back-end) and focus more on coding. I also believe there is a lot of disparity in women and male representation in the field and I would like to bridge that gap.

Founders and Coders particularly stood out to me because it is a charity that actively gives back to the community. I would like to be in a position where I can develop my skills and also share my knowledge. I particularly would like to work on software programming that would merge my interest in agriculture and IT. I believe the advancement in agritech is becoming more pravelent in the IT industry and I would like to be a part of it.

So far, I have enjoyed my time, attending the short course woerking towards this prerequisites and I am excited to join this Winter’s cohort.
