      <strong> Who am I? </strong>

      <p>I didn't just want to tweek code on wordpress, i wanted to be the designer behind the themes. I am follwing my dreams. I would hope to gain a basic software engineering knowledge, that would provide me an opportunity at pursing a career in software
        development. I would like to interact with other individuals in the same boat as me or who are even more advanced so we can sharpen our skills together. I would like to meet women who are already working in software engineering and find out what
        their route was in creating a career path in this line of work. I would like to find out what the culture in a typical IT environment is like and whether there are more initiatives for women to get into IT and develop their skills in this area.
        It would also be encouraging for Sky to expose students more to the practicality of the role and what other courses can be taken to develop my skills in software engineering.

      </p>
